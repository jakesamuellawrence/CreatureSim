	-End User Survey															Completed
		Reflection: Once the survey had already been sent out I realised
					one of the proposed names for the project may infringe
					on the Copyrights, Designs, and Patents act. For this
					reason, I chose to discount that name from the question,
					no matter how many people chose it as the best.
		
2018-06-25
	-End User Survey Analysis													Completed
		Reflection: User responses about the priority of features 
	   			    differed greatly from my own judgements about 
					what order to develop features in. To solve this,
					I have decided to make a compromise between the 
					survey responses and my own intuitions

	-Initial Gantt Chart														Started
		Reflection: Gantt chart was made after most of the analysis phase
					and so the times for those were filled in instead of 
					planned
					
2018-08-30
	-Initial Gantt Chart														Completed
		Reflection: none
	-Outline Project Plan														Completed
		Reflection: I realised the predicted final date for project finish
					is after the due date for the projects to be completed.
					However, this should not be a problem as this date is
					likely an overestimation, as it assumes that an hour is
					done each week, where in reality more will likely be done
					each week, both in class and at home

	-Revised Gantt Chart														Edited
		Reflections: I realised I did not include a subsegment for designing
					 the neural net (i.e input data, nodes, outputs etc.).
					 This will be added to the Revised Gantt chart as and when
					 I come to complete it
	-Requirements Specification													Started
		Reflections: None
		
2018-09-13
	-Requirements Specification													Completed
		Reflections: None
	-Setup Git and link to github repo											Completed
		Reflections: This was done to provide version control incase changes
					 need to be rolled back, to create a backup in case data
					 is lost, and so that the project can easily be worked on
					 at home.
					 Problems were encountered with git opening the wrong text
					 editor for commit messages. This was overcome by doing some
					 research on StackOverflow on how to change the default text
					 editor for git
	-Commit and push all current documents and files to origin					Completed
