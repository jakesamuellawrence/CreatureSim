2018-06-19
	-Feasibility Study															Completed
		Reflection: none
		
2018-06-21
	-End User Survey															Completed
		Reflection: Once the survey had already been sent out I realised
					one of the proposed names for the project may infringe
					on the Copyrights, Designs, and Patents act. For this
					reason, I chose to discount that name from the question,
					no matter how many people chose it as the best.
		
2018-06-25
	-End User Survey Analysis													Completed
		Reflection: User responses about the priority of features 
	   			    differed greatly from my own judgements about 
					what order to develop features in. To solve this,
					I have decided to make a compromise between the 
					survey responses and my own intuitions
	
					
2018-08-23
	-Initial Gantt Chart														Started
		Reflection: Gantt chart was made after most of the analysis phase
					and so the times for those were filled in instead of 
					planned
					
2018-08-30
	-Initial Gantt Chart														Completed
		Reflection: none
	-Outline Project Plan														Completed
		Reflection: I realised the predicted final date for project finish
					is after the due date for the projects to be completed.
					However, this should not be a problem as this date is
					likely an overestimation, as it assumes that an hour is
					done each week, where in reality more will likely be done
					each week, both in class and at home
		
2018-09-06
	-Revised Gantt Chart														Edited
		Reflections: I realised I did not include a subsegment for designing
					 the neural net (i.e input data, nodes, outputs etc.).
					 This will be added to the Revised Gantt chart as and when
					 I come to complete it
	-Requirements Specification													Started
		Reflections: None
		
2018-09-13
	-Requirements Specification													Completed
		Reflections: None
	-Setup Git and link to github repo											Completed
		Reflections: This was done to provide version control incase changes
					 need to be rolled back, to create a backup in case data
					 is lost, and so that the project can easily be worked on
					 at home.
					 Problems were encountered with git opening the wrong text
					 editor for commit messages. This was overcome by doing some
					 research on StackOverflow on how to change the default text
					 editor for git
	-Add, commit and push all current documents and files to origin				Completed

		-Reflections: None
	-Revised Gantt Chart														Edited
		-Reflections: Edited to reflect the test plan
		
2018-09-20
	-Neural Net and Evolution Design											Committed
		-Reflections: A small amount of research had to be done on nodes and
					  layers in a neural net.
					  
2018-09-27
	-Neural Net and Evolution Design											Committed
		-Reflections: Edited to add a bias node to the net design (A node which
					  Always has a value of 1)
	-UI Wireframe																Completed
	-UI Design																	Started
		-Reflections: None
	-Detailed Project Plan,														Edited
	 End User Survey Analysis,													Edited
	 Revised Gantt Chart,														Edited
	 Requirements Specification,												Edited
	 Test Plan																	Edited
		-Reflections: Edited to change all occurrences of 'average food graph'
					  to 'average survival time graph'
					  
2018-10-4
	-UI Design																	Committed
		-Reflections: A functional requirement was removed because I 
	  				  realised that it was not feasible to include in the UI
	-Requirements Specification													Edited
		-Reflections: see above
		
2018-10-11
	-Class Model Diagram														Committed
		-Reflections: See below
		
2018-10-25
	-Pseudocode																	Started
		-Reflections: How to approach pseudocode was at first a challenge, given
					  my project was being done in an object oriented way, which
					  is not as well suited to pseudocode. I decided that instead
					  of trying to detail out how the actual object oriented code
					  will look, I would instead describe the algorithms and flow
					  of the program. This means my pseudocode does not show any
					  class or objects or relationships, but these are all shown
					  by my Class Model diagram instead.
					  
2018-11-01
	-Pseudocode																	Committed
		-Reflections: Continuing my pseudocode this week puts me two hours
					  behind schedule. However, I do not believe this to be a
					  problem, as work can be done out-with school if and when
					  it is needed
	-Frame and Panel: Implementation											Started
		-Reflections: I needed to carry out research into the different
					  available JREs before starting implementation
					  
2018-11-08
	-Frame and Panel: Implementation											Continued
		-Reflections: I needed to research javadoc syntax in order to write
					  as clear as possible internal commentary
					  
2018-11-22
	-Frame and Panel: Implementation											Committed
		-Reflections: The coding of the Frame and Panel component was completed
					  but component testing needed to be done before the code
					  was committed.
	-Frame and Panel: Testing													Committed
		-Reflections: A block of code known as a driver had to be written in
					  to test the component.
	-Neural Net: Implementation													Started
	
2018-11-26
	-Neural Net: Implementation and Testing										Continued
		-Reflections: Originally, I had chosen the sigmoid function to act
					  as the transfer function for most nodes in the network
					  however as I was developing the network I was unsure as
					  to whether this would be able to allow the networks to
					  operate as I desired. However, after some research and
					  sketching of various functions, I determined that sigmoid
					  was in fact satisfactory

		-Reflections: None
	-Neural Net Design															Edited
		-Reflections: Neural Net Design changed to reflect the research 
					  mentioned above
					  
2018-12-06																		
	-Neural Net: Implementation and Testing										Continued
		-Reflections: It was noticed during testing that no nodes were being
					  given negative weights, and so this was fixed.

2018-12-20
	-Buttons and Menus research													Started
		-Reflections: During my research I realised I would need to approach a
					  certain part of implementation in a slightly different
					  way than originally intended. These changes have been
					  reflected in the Class Model Diagrams.
	-Buttons and Menus implementation											Started
		-Reflections: None
	
2019-01-31
	-Buttons and Menus research													Continued
		-Reflections: I had never created a GUI in java before, and a great
					  deal of research into various LayoutManagers needed
					  to be done.
	-Buttons and Menus implementation											Continued
		-Reflections: The resources that were found on LayoutManagers were
					  in places vague and unclear, or not suited to my 
					  specific application. This meant that a large amount
					  amount of trial and error and experimentation had to
					  be done in order to find a viable solution. This 
					  put the project significantly behind schedule, however
					  this is okay as plans have been made to carry out a large
					  portion of the work out-with school time

2019-02-21
	-Buttons and Menus research													Continued
		-Reflections: None
	-Buttons and Menus implementation											Continued
		-Reflections: It was realised during the process of implementation that
					  the main menu may look better if the buttons were to have
					  borders. This will be tested, and if successful, will be
					  reflected when the high fidelity prototype is created.
					
2019-02-28
	-Buttons and Menus research													Continued
		-Reflections: None
	-Buttons and Menus implementation											Continued
		-Reflections: It was realised that the default java library for
					  displaying graphics did not have a feature to automatically
					  wrap text within a certain region, so an algorithm to
					  do this head to be written and implemented by me.

2019-03-04
	-Buttons and Menus research													Continued
		-Reflections: None
	-Buttons and Menus implementation											Continued
		-Reflections: Issues were faced in the design of the word wrap
		              algorithm due to logical errors in the design. 
		              However, these have been overcome.

	-Slow Generation implementation												Committed
		-Reflections: Some slight deviations have been needed to be made from 
					  the original designs and plans. The designs will be left 
					  as they originally were, so the differences between them
					  can be seen.

	-Slow Generation implementation												Committed
		-Reflections: The original design for the evolutional learning stated
					  that the creatures must compete within walls, which will
					  slowly move inwards to ensure that all creatures die
					  eventually. However, it was realised this was not actually
					  needed, as the rate of new food pellets being added can be
					  set to an optimum value such that no single creature can 
					  stay alive forever.
