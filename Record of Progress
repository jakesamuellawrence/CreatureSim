	-Feasibility Study															Completed
		Reflection: none
		
2018-06-21
	-End User Survey															Completed
		Reflection: Once the survey had already been sent out I realised
					one of the proposed names for the project may infringe
					on the Copyrights, Designs, and Patents act. For this
					reason, I chose to discount that name from the question,
					no matter how many people chose it as the best.
		
2018-06-25
	-End User Survey Analysis													Completed
		Reflection: User responses about the priority of features 
	   			    differed greatly from my own judgements about 
					what order to develop features in. To solve this,
					I have decided to make a compromise between the 
					survey responses and my own intuitions
	
					
2018-08-23
	-Initial Gantt Chart														Started
		Reflection: Gantt chart was made after most of the analysis phase
					and so the times for those were filled in instead of 
					planned
					
2018-08-30
	-Initial Gantt Chart														Completed
		Reflection: none
	-Outline Project Plan														Completed
		Reflection: I realised the predicted final date for project finish
					is after the due date for the projects to be completed.
					However, this should not be a problem as this date is
					likely an overestimation, as it assumes that an hour is
					done each week, where in reality more will likely be done
					each week, both in class and at home
		
2018-09-06
	-Revised Gantt Chart														Edited
		Reflections: I realised I did not include a subsegment for designing
					 the neural net (i.e input data, nodes, outputs etc.).
					 This will be added to the Revised Gantt chart as and when
					 I come to complete it
	-Requirements Specification													Started
		Reflections: None
		
2018-09-13
	-Requirements Specification													Completed
		Reflections: None
	-Setup Git and link to github repo											Completed
		Reflections: This was done to provide version control incase changes
					 need to be rolled back, to create a backup in case data
					 is lost, and so that the project can easily be worked on
					 at home.
					 Problems were encountered with git opening the wrong text
					 editor for commit messages. This was overcome by doing some
					 research on StackOverflow on how to change the default text
					 editor for git
	-Add, commit and push all current documents and files to origin				Completed

		-Reflections: A functional requirement was removed because I 
	  				  realised that it was not feasible to include in the UI
	-Requirements Specification													Edited
		-Reflections: see above
		
2018-10-11
	-Class Model Diagram														Committed
		-Reflections: See below
		
2018-10-25
	-Pseudocode																	Started
		-Reflections: How to approach pseudocode was at first a challenge, given
					  my project was being done in an object oriented way, which
					  is not as well suited to pseudocode. I decided that instead
					  of trying to detail out how the actual object oriented code
					  will look, I would instead describe the algorithms and flow
					  of the program. This means my pseudocode does not show any
					  class or objects or relationships, but these are all shown
					  by my Class Model diagram instead.
					  
2018-11-01
	-Pseudocode																	Committed
		-Reflections: Continuing my pseudocode this week puts me two hours
					  behind schedule. However, I do not believe this to be a
					  problem, as work can be done out-with school if and when
					  it is needed
	-Frame and Panel: Implementation											Started
		-Reflections: I needed to carry out research into the different
					  available JREs before starting implementation
					  
2018-11-08
	-Frame and Panel: Implementation											Continued
		-Reflections: I needed to research javadoc syntax in order to write
					  as clear as possible internal commentary
					  
2018-11-22
	-Frame and Panel: Implementation											Committed
		-Reflections: The coding of the Frame and Panel component was completed
					  but component testing needed to be done before the code
					  was committed.
	-Frame and Panel: Testing													Committed
		-Reflections: A block of code known as a driver had to be written in
					  to test the component.
	-Neural Net: Implementation													Started
	
2018-11-26
	-Neural Net: Implementation and Testing										Continued
		-Reflections: Originally, I had chosen the sigmoid function to act
					  as the transfer function for most nodes in the network
					  however as I was developing the network I was unsure as
					  to whether this would be able to allow the networks to
					  operate as I desired. However, after some research and
					  sketching of various functions, I determined that sigmoid
					  was in fact satisfactory

	-Neural Net: Implementation and Testing										Continued
		-Reflections: It was noticed during testing that no nodes were being
					  given negative weights, and so this was fixed.

	-Buttons and Menus research													Started
		-Reflections: During my research I realised I would need to approach a
					  certain part of implementation in a slightly different
					  way than originally intended. These changes have been
					  reflected in the Class Model Diagrams.
	-Buttons and Menus implementation											Started
		-Reflections: None
	
2019-01-31
	-Buttons and Menus research													Continued
		-Reflections: I had never created a GUI in java before, and a great
					  deal of research into various LayoutManagers needed
					  to be done.
	-Buttons and Menus implementation											Continued
		-Reflections: The resources that were found on LayoutManagers were
					  in places vague and unclear, or not suited to my 
					  specific application. This meant that a large amount
					  amount of trial and error and experimentation had to
					  be done in order to find a viable solution. This 
					  put the project significantly behind schedule, however
					  this is okay as plans have been made to carry out a large
					  portion of the work out-with school time

	-Buttons and Menus research													Continued
		-Reflections: None
	-Buttons and Menus implementation											Continued
		-Reflections: It was realised during the process of implementation that
					  the main menu may look better if the buttons were to have
					  borders. This will be tested, and if successful, will be
					  reflected when the high fidelity prototype is created.
					
2019-02-28
	-Buttons and Menus research													Continued
		-Reflections: None
	-Buttons and Menus implementation											Continued
		-Reflections: It was realised that the default java library for
					  displaying graphics did not have a feature to automatically
					  wrap text within a certain region, so an algorithm to
					  do this head to be written and implemented by me.

	-Buttons and Menus research													Continued
		-Reflections: None
	-Buttons and Menus implementation											Continued
		-Reflections: Issues were faced in the design of the word wrap
		              algorithm due to logical errors in the design. 
		              However, these have been overcome.

	-Slow Generation implementation												Committed
		-Reflections: It was realised that the original designs for how the
					  neural nets would work were not appropriate for how
					  creatures are designed. Several changes have been made:
					  First, creatures do not have a separate energy and radius
					  anymore, the initial radius is just set to 1, and this 
					  represents their energy. Every tick a creature's radius
					  decreases by a set amount. If a creature's radius is
					  lower than 0.5, it dies. Thirdly, there are no longer
					  any 'walls' that move in after a set time. It is simply
					  ensured that the creatures cannot survive indefinitely
					  by throttling the production of food.

	-Slow Generation implementation												Committed
		-Reflections: The original design for the evolutional learning stated
					  that the creatures must compete within walls, which will
					  slowly move inwards to ensure that all creatures die
					  eventually. However, it was realised this was not actually
					  needed, as the rate of new food pellets being added can be
					  set to an optimum value such that no single creature can 
					  stay alive forever.

2019-03-18
	-Slow Generation implementation												Committed
		-Reflections: Currently, the creatures get information about their
					  surroundings, but cannot learn. To implement learning,
					  when a generation ends a new generation must be made from
					  the best of the previous generation

	-Highest Survival Time Graph implementation									Committed
		-Reflections: Originally, the graph was intended to be of average
					  survival times, and for highest and lowest to only be
					  implemented later. However, it was decided that highest
					  survival time would be prioritised instead, as it
					  is a more insightful statistic.
	-Neural net overhaul														Committed
		-Reflections: It was decided that the Sigmoid transfer function was not
					  sufficient for the needs of the neural net. For this
					  reason, all input and all hidden layer nodes were changed
					  to use the tanh transfer function

2019-03-25
	-Highest Survival Time Graph implementation									Committed
		-Reflections: Now that the results of competitions are being graphed,
					  it is clear that the creatures are not really 
					  'learning', as little to no improvement can be observed
					  in survival times from generation to generation. However,
					  this will not be addressed until after all other features
					  have been implemented properly

2019-03-26
	-Creature Names implementation												Committed
		-Reflections: Originally, it was planned that 'Creature cannibalism'
					  would be the next task undertaken. However, it was
					  decided that creature cannibalism would not be
					  implemented at all as it would actually impede the
					  creature's ability to learn.

	-Whole Project commentary													Committed
		-Reflections: Ensuring that all subroutines are properly commented
					  with adequate and sufficient information
	-Average and Lowest survival time graph										Committed
		-Reflections: It was decided average and lowest survival time graphs
					  should now be implemented as it provides more insight
					  into whether the creatures are learning
					  
2019-03-30
	-Creature learning															Committed
		-Reflections: Now that the majority of the features have been
					  implemented, I have decided to attempt to rework the way
					  the creature's brain works entirely. They are now only
					  given one input: a boolean of whether or not food is in
					  front of them. Additionally, the net now has four boolean
					  outputs: should move forwards, should move backwards,
					  should turn left, should turn right. Lastly, a creature's
					  movement and turning speed are now set values are cannot
					  change.
					  
2019-03-31
	-Creature learning tweaks													Committed
		-Reflections: Creatures are now successfully learning a good technique
					  for finding food, however I'm not entirely happy with the
					  way this turns out, as it leads to a spike in survival time
					  when one creature figures it out, and then a decline in
					  as they all figure it out. A few changes have been made to
					  combat this. First, creatures are now given two inputs:
					  the distance to whatever they're looking at, expressed as a 
					  proportion of the spawn area, and their current radius.
					  Secondly, creatures now lose energy faster when they are 
					  larger. Lastly, the way food is added into the arena is now
					  changed: food is now added more often when there are more 
					  creatures

	-Further Creature name implementation
		-Reflections: It was realised that there is no point in giving creatures

					  add a box above each creature displaying their name
	-Functionality and Usability testing										Committed
		-Reflections: None
	-UI Tweaks																	Committed
		-Reflections: After some beta user feedback, I have decided to alter
					  one of the elements of the User interface slightly, 
					  replacing the text box that previously simply described
					  neural nets with a textbox describing how to use the
					  program and what it's purpose is.
	-Usability testing and end-user surveys
		-Refections: Now that a few usability suggestions had been implemented,
					 I decided it was ready to call it a release and send it to
					 potential end-users for testing, along with a survey for 
					 them to fill out
